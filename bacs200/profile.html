<p>Hello!!! </p>

<p> Thank you for reading! My name is Caden, almost everyone calls me Caden, my family sometimes calls me fun nicknames 
  such as Big C, or Cader-Patater, but most people call me Caden. </p>

<p>I really enjoy games, pretty much any type of game, whether it be video games, bored games, sports, or made up games, I generally really enjoy them.
  I also have a ton of fun watching movies and hanging out with my friends as well as my family. </p>

<p>What I do besides school, is work, hang out with my family and friends, and I'm also heavily involved in my church, Summitview Community Church in Evans. 
  What is really cool for me is that I have an opportunity to work with, as well as go to church with several of my friends, and that is super awesome. </p>

<p>I'm 19 years old, and right now I'm working on my Software Engineering major at UNC. This is my third year of college, I am gratefull for the opportunity 
  that I had to knock out some college credits while I was in highschool to get double credit for them, and I'm really looking forward to learning at UNC and 
  learning all about Software Engineering!</p>
