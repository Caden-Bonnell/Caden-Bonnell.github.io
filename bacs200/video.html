                    <ul>
                        <li>The Bible is the inspired word of God given to us through men who came from God and were inspired by the Holy Spirit. (2 Timothy 3:16, 2 Peter 1:21)</li>
                        <li>All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. (Romans 3:23)</li>
                        <li>The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus (Romans 6:23).</li>
                        <li>Jesus Christ, who was one with God, fully God, and fully man, was born of a virgin, experienced every temptation we will ever experience, yet lived a completely sinless life, died for all of humanity as a substitutionary sacrifice, and rose again on the third day. (John 10:30, John 1:1, Luke 1:26-35, Hebrews 2:18, 1 John 3:5, 1 John 2:2 and Isaiah 53:5-6, Matthew 28:6 and 1 Peter 1:3)  </li>
                        <li>We can be justified (made right with God) freely through the gift of grace from Jesus Christ, who paid for all our sins with His own blood, when we recieve Jesus and beleive in His name. (Romans 2:24, Ephesians 1:7, John 1:12)</li>
                        <li>When we recieve Jesus, the Holy Spirit (part of the trinity of God) comes into us and changes us from our sinful ways so that we can live life in response to God's goodness towards us. (Acts 5:3-4, Titus 3:5, Romans 8:9, Ephesians 2:8-9) </li>
                        <li>The Holy Spirit also seals us until the day that Jesus comes back to get us or we die, whichever comes first. (Ephesians 1:13-14, John 10:23-30, Romans 8:38-39, Romans 14:9, 1 Peter 1:5, Jude 24) </li>
                        <li>We are loved by God as is shown by Him sending His own Son Jesus to die for us, so that we can become the children of God. (1 John 4:9, 1 John 3:1)</li>
                        <li>As we loved so much by God, we are told to go into the world and make disciples of all nations, to baptize them in the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, and to teach them to obey everything God has commanded us, for surely He is with us always until the end of time! (Matthew 28:19-20)</li>

                        <p>Hi! My name is Caden Bonnell, and what I’m going to talk about today, is my church, Summitview Community Church. </p>
                        <p>
                            <span class="text-danger">What is Summitview?</span>
                            Summitview is a nonprofit organization, located a few minutes from UNC, right near the junction of 37th St. and HWY 85. We have church on Sunday mornings from 9:30 to 11:00, and we also have many other groups to get involved in, such as the college group, youth group, and community groups which all meet weekly.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <span class="text-danger">So what do we believe?</span>
                            We believe that the church exists to glorify God, by proclaiming the good news of Jesus Christ, and equipping God's people to live in light of that good news. We believe that the good news of Jesus Christ is that He came down to earth, taking on the full sin of all humanity, whether that sin is present sin, past sin, or future sin, Jesus took that sin upon himself, and then willingly died to pay the price of our sin. Then, three days later, Jesus was raised from the dead and now is in heaven preparing a place for us. We believe we are also called in Matthew 28:19-20 to share the good news of Jesus Christ with those around us. We have something special, the answer to sin, pain, guilt, and shame, why would we not share the answer? We also believe that we are also called to equip others to live like they have the gift of eternal life with Christ! We do that on Sunday mornings and other groups that we are a part of weekly, but we also do that by holding each other accountable and spurring one another on towards love and good deeds as is shown in Hebrews 10:24.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <span class="text-danger">What is our view on the Bible?</span>
                            The Bible gives us our understanding for who God is! We believe that the Bible is the perfect, inspired word of God, written for us and to us in a way that is understandable, so that we can gain an understanding of the love of God and how He wants us to live our lives. The Bible has been finished, nothing else should be added to it, everything inside of it is the word of God and is more than sufficient for us to know what God’s will for us is.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <span class="text-danger">We also believe that God loves us:</span>
                            John 3:16 - “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.” Romans 3:22-25 - “For there is no distinction:  for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith.” Matthew 28:20 - “And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” That is a promise. Philippians 4:4-7 -  “Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice.  Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 - “Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.”

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            One thing that is cool about our church, is that we believe in the inerrancy of scripture and word of God. And as we believe in that, we can take the word of God at face value, because we’re not skipping anything, we’re not ignoring anything, we believe it’s all from God. So these promises have a whole new meaning when we know that they are meant for us and are truth. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So this is Summitview Community Church, and thank you for listening!
