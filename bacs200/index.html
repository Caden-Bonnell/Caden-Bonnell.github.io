<p>Hi! Did you know that as a funny attempt at humor, one can add the phrase "in the bathroom" to the end of any fortune cookie that they read? </p>

<p>An example might be, "A dubious friend may be an enemy in camouflage. ---- in the bathroom." </p>

<p>Another example might be, "A fresh start will put you on your way. ---- in the bathroom." </p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this and if you didn't I'm sorry you had to read this! </p>
