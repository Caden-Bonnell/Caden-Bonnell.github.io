<p>When I think of a hero, I think of someone who actually acts on what they beleive. They don't only think about it and fail
  to act becuase it bars their comfort or causes them an inconvenience, but they thrust all aside, and dive headfirst into following their belief,
  and they turn that beleif into a reality. As a Christian, I beleive that there is no greater purpose than to follow than Jesus Christ, and Jim Elliot 
  did just that. 
 </p>

<p>What makes Jim Elliot an inspiration to me, is that at the age of 23, he left everything he knew, and entered linguistic 
  training to become a missionary to a tribe of people called the Aucas who lived in Ecuador. He knew that it would be dangerous, 
  but beleived that his calling to follow God was greater than all of that. In his journal, he famously wrote, "he is no fool 
  who gives what he cannot keep to gain that which he cannot lose." </p>

<p> Just shortly after Elliot made contact with the Aucas, he and the four other missionary men who had come with him were 
  speared to death. They had completely given their lives following Jesus, and were glad for it. Elliot said, before their deaths, 
  that "When it comes time to die, make sure all you have to do is die." He had risked his life, and actually lived it to the fullest, acting in his beliefs.
