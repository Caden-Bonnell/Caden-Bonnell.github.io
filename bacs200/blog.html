    <p class="col-12 p-6 mb-5 h5" >Climate Change is defined by the National Geographic Society as the “long-term shift in global or regional climate patterns.” 
        <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/climate-change/">(Climate Change)</a>
          This means that climate change considers the long term, new normal change in weather variability. So now that we are clear about what climate change is, let us look at a specific example of climate change, which is currently global warming.

    <h2 class="text-secondary text-center col-12 bg-warning">Social Implications</h2>

    <p class="col-12 p-2 mb-5 h5 text-center" >The media in more recent years has made a very big deal regarding global warming, and to the average person, global warming may seem like something that has become an issue very recently. However, if we look at the climate change history, we see that we have swung to both ends of the spectrum. </p>
    <ul class="col-12 p-5 mb-5 h5 text-center" >
        <li>1315-1850’s -- Little Ice Age</li>
        <li>1930’s -- Global Warming was first being observed with an increase in CO2</li>
        <li>1970’s  -- Global Cooling occurs, as the increase of pollutants were blocking the sun</li>
        <li>1988 -- Global Warming hits and the earth starts heating up with an increase in CO2</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="col-12 p-2 mb-5 h5 text-center" >
    While the CO2 levels have been and are increasing, crazy things can, have, and do happen that throw everything off, as is evident by the fires and pandemic we see today. 
    
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-secondary text-center col-12 bg-warning mt-5">Economic Implications</h2>

    <p class="col-12 p-2 mb-5 h5 text-center" >Several billion dollars are spent on climate change every year, and there have been several actions taken by U.S Presidents in response to climate change.
    </p>

    <ol class="col-12 p-5 mb-5 h5 text-left">
        <li>1997 -- Kyoto Protocol: signed by Bill Clinton, called to reduce emissions of 6 greenhouse gasses in 41 countries plus the EU</li>
        <li>2001 -- Kyoto Protocol revoked by George Bush: George Bush said the protocol was “fatally flawed” and would hurt the U.S. economy</li>
        <li>2015 -- Paris Climate Agreement: U.S. signed on to the agreement under President Obama</li>
        <li>2016 -- Paris Climate Agreement revoked by Donald Trump: Donald Trump said he could “not support a deal that punishes the United States.” </li>
    </ol>

    

    <h2 class="text-secondary text-center col-12 bg-warning mt-5">Political Implications</h2>

    <p class="col-12 p-2 mb-5 h5 text-center" >As you can see here, it is almost as if the push for climate change is split across party lines, so what can we take away from this? </p>

    <ol class="col-12 p-5  p-2 mb-5 h5 text-center">
        <li>We have to believe that whatever the current U.S. President is doing, they are doing it with their belief of the country's best interests in mind. </li>
        <li>While the decisions for how we should approach climate change are split among party lines, we as Americans should not split ourselves among party lines, but need to remain unified as Americans, because that is what we are.</li>
        <li>There is a truth out there about climate change, and there is a cost associated with it. Do we as Americans, as a WHOLE, want to find the truth, or do we want to push our side, because those are two completely different things.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="text-secondary text-center col-12 bg-warning mt-5">Conclusion</h2>

     <p  class="col-12 p-2 mb-5 h5 text-center">In conclusion, we looked at climate change history, how we went from an ice age, to global warming, to global cooling, and now to global warming, all with an increase in CO2. Second, we looked at what is being done by the United States to deal with this issue. And finally, we approached this issue, not as a member of a political party, but as an American who wants to find the truth. If we are all looking for the truth, what would we look like as a country? </p>
